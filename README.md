# goody
This project has me excited because I get to code examples of things that I know many people struggle with. My hope is that someone will find it, download it and improve it. I wasn't sure what to call this project so I named it how I felt at the time. I looked up the meaning on Google: Expressing childish delight. "Goody, we can have a party!" I hope you join the party. :)
